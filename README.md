# Heatwaves and elderly population exposure in China: historical trends and future projections
The primary objectives of this study are to: 
(1) validate temperature data based on outputs from 30 CMIP6 models and downscale them to an 11 km resolution; 
(2) analyze the historical and projected spatiotemporal variations in heatwave frequency using EHF definitions, with the 1971-2000 period as the reference baseline; 
(3) assess and decompose the exposure of the elderly population to heatwaves, examining both historical data (2001-2020) and future projections (2041-2100). 
These efforts aim to provide valuable insights for long-term heatwave patterns and their impacts, thereby enabling the targeted strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of heatwaves, particularly on elderly populations.

 The primary objectives of this study are to: 
 (1) examine the historical (1971-2020) and projected (2041-2100) spatiotemporal variations in heatwave frequency across China based on the EHF definitions; 
 (2) assess the historical (2001-2020) and future (2041-2100) exposure of the elderly population to heatwaves under different SSP scenarios; and 
 (3) decompose the driving factors of elderly heatwave exposure into climate effect, population effect, and their interaction effect, thereby identifying the relative contribution of each component.
 
 Together, these objectives aim to improve the understanding of long-term heatwave dynamics and their implications for vulnerable populations, thereby informing targeted adaptation strategies in the context of population aging and climate change.
